# quotes

## lab 8
in this application we have a Json file that contains data about quotes : 

- tags: what the quote is about  
- author: the one who wrote that quote  
- likes: how many like the quote got  
- text: the quote it self  

every time you run the program it will give you the quote it self and the author who wrote the quote randomly like : 

`{"author":"Marilyn Monroe","text": “I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.” }`

## lab 9
• **we added an api so everytime you run the code it will give you a random quote and its author, and it will be added to the json file**

- if there is an internet problem or a problem with the api it will give you a quote from the file it self that contains the quote
