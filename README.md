# quotes

in this application we have a Json file that contains data about quotes : 

- tags: what the quote is about  
- author: the one who wrote that quote  
- likes: how many like the quote got  
- text: the quote it self  

every time you run the program it will give you the quote it self and the author who wrote the quote randomly like : 

`{"author":"Marilyn Monroe","text": “I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.” }`
